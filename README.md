# Minimum Viable Startpage
This is a startpage I put together on one lazy afternoon. It does not auto-search and does not contain dragons. But it looks pretty, and does contain a cat. Cheers.

## Installation
To install the startpage and use it on your local machine, simply clone the repository and set your browser's new tab URL to the `index.html` filepath.

(Note: Your browser may not support changing new tab's URL natively. I use [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) extension for Chrome.)
